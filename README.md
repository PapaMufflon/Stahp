Stahp
=====

Application to notify you when you're longer than time x on your computer (so you know you should do something else...)

Compile and put it in your Autostart-menu. A System Tray icon will appear. The tooltip of that icon
will show you your remaining time. You can change the remaining time when you click on the icon. A time control
will appear to set the remaining time.

When the remaining time counts down to zero, a balloon tip will show up remainding you to stahp sitting on your computer
and do something else.
